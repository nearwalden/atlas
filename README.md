# Atlas Data Management System	

This is the source for the Atlas data management system.  I'm writing a simple system to track the data for analytics projects since I haven't been able to find a good alternative.  Many systems exist, but they are either too heavy weight for what I need or are opinionated in a direction that doesn't suit me.

Python packages:
- `pymongo`
- `yaml`
